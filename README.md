About                    :The PIS is not at all a database related app nor like  the
conventional shopping website.

Instead it’s an electronic item description portal.Here you will get
the total accessible information about any electronic product that is
available widely across the country.

This android based application is a pure Android UI with the necessity
of ease of use for the end-user so that you may use in any hazardous
conditions even offline.Weather it maybe the product images or the
current prices,the PIS widely covers all these aspects.The only thing
we don’t offer is sales because this app is intended only for
information about product and no marketing stratergy.


Install			             :Traditional Android Installation.
Usage                    :Use by simply touching the highly responsive GUI components.
